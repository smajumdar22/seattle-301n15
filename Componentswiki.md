Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. 
Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t 
have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that 
reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> 
where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.

Example - 
<!-- views/post.ejs -->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>POST_TITLE | Node.js Blog</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        <style>
            body {
                padding-top: 20px;
                padding-bottom: 20px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <%- include('partials/navbar') %>
            <div>
                <h2>POST_TITLE</h2>
                <p>by <a href="#">POST_AUTHOR</a></p>
                <p>POST_CONTENT</p>
                <hr>
            </div>
            <%- include('partials/footer') %>
        </div>
    </body>
    </html>
