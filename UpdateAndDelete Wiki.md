The web is based on a very basic client/server architecture that can be summarized 
as follows: a client (usually a Web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like 
Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.
On the client side, an HTML form is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request
to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the 
request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.
